        <p><b>In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data in your programs. JavaScript has three keywords for declaring variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. <br> These keywords have different behavior and scoping rules.</b></p>
        <p><b style="font-size: larger;">'Var' ( Function-Scoped or Global-Scoped):</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function in which they are declared.</li>
            <li>Variables declared with `var` are also hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope during the compilation phase.</li>
            <li>'var` variables can be re-declared within the same scope.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b style="font-size: larger;">'Let' (Block-Scoped):</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the block in which they are defined (block can be a function, loop, or any code enclosed in curly braces).</li>
            <li>Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until the point in the code where they are declared. This is known as the "temporal dead zone."</li>
            <li>`let` variables cannot be re-declared within the same scope.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b style="font-size: larger;">'Const' (Block-Scoped):</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with `const` are also block-scoped.</li>
            <li>`const` variables must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be changed (reassigned) after initialization. However, the value of a `const` object or array can be mutated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>JavaScript has several data types that can be broadly categorized into two main categories: PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES AND REFERENCE DATA TYPES.</b></p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:</b></p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Number:</b> Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. Examples: `10`, `3.14`.
            <br><br>
            <b>2. String:</b> Representing textual data in quotations is known as String. Examples: `"Hello, World!"`, `'JavaScript'`.
            <br><br>
            <b>3. Boolean:</b> Represents true or false values. Examples: `true`, `false`.
            <br><br>
           <b> 4. Undefined:</b> Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. 
            <br><br>
             <b>5. Null:</b> Represents an intentional absence of any object value or no value.

            <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>REFERENCE DATA TYPES:</b></p>

        <p>

            <b>1. Object:</b> Represents complex data structures and is used for collections of data, functions, or methods. Objects are key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be any data type.
            <br><br>
            <b>2. Array:</b> A special type of object used for storing an ordered list of values. Elements in an array can be of any data type.
            <br><br>
            <b>3. Function:</b> Functions are objects, and they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Functions are used to perform specific tasks or calculations.
